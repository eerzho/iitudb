We  didn’t get the Many-to-Many connection, there was a mistake in the code and we hastened to create controllers
and migrate. And when we found the error, we were not able to remove the old controllers and migration. And they decided to 
make a new project again, but we don’t have time so you can check this code. We will change the names of Models to the next
part.
